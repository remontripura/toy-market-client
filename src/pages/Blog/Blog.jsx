                <p>MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, provides a powerful feature called the Aggregation Framework. This framework empowers developers to perform complex data manipulations, transformations, and aggregations directly within the database.</p> <br />
                <p>The MongoDB Aggregation Framework works by processing data through a series of stages within a pipeline. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data and passes the results to the next stage. The final output of the pipeline is the transformed and aggregated data that matches your desired criteria.</p>
